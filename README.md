# Trading-Card-Search-Filter

This algorithm was made as a practice exercise for learning Java and practicing data parsing algorithms. Ideally 
for a search bar, the .txt file should have its contents uploaded into a SQL database and the search bar would
function by returning queries on the database with the user's input but the algorithm was written without knowledge 
of better tools at the time.
